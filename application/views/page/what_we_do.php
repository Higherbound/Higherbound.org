                    <h2 class="line replace">Lunch Hour Visitation :</h2>
                    <p>Building relationships with students is one of the most important aspects of ministry to students.  Each day the director of Higher Bound is able to go into the school and spend time building relationships with the students during their lunch hour and is available to talk with students one on one as needed.</p>
                    <h2 class="line replace">Tutoring and Mentors :</h2>
                    <p>Higher Bound provides mentors to at risk students. These mentors are committed  Christians who volunteer 8-12 hours a week to their student. Mentors take students on  outings, help them with homework, and spend time with them at the HIGHER BOUND HOUSE.</p>
                    <h2 class="line replace">Fellowship :</h2>
                    <p>Occasionally we offer fellowship outings for well deserving students. These outings consist of picnics, roller skate parties, holiday parties, concerts, outdoor activities, etc., for them to enjoy as a reward for positive behavior.</p>
                    <h2 class="line replace">T.N.T. (Tuesday Night Teaching) & T.N.S. (Thursday Night Study) :</h2>
                    <p>Every Tuesday and Thursday from 3pm - 6pm, we offer a time for students to learn positive moral values, biblical teaching, and ways they can serve their community, school, and family.</p>
                    <h2 class="line replace">Safe House :</h2>
                    <p>Higher Bound's most effective ministry is the Higher Bound House which is across the street from the middle school. The house serves as a safe after school alternative and is open from 3:00-7:00 Monday through Friday. It functions as a safe place where students can be tutored or mentored, play games, build relationships with peers, Higher Bound staff and volunteers, and participate in character building activities based on sound biblical principles.</p>
                    <h2 class="line replace">Saturday Activity Thing (SAT) :</h2>
                    <p>Higher Bound's latest program, This SAT isn't a test, instead its a chance to get together every other weekend for one day of fun. Each activity is different and exciting!! We invite you to join us and be with friends!! -
